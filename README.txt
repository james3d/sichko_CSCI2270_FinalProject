Project Summary

J&C Inc is an automobile parts manufacturer. In order to have the right amount of material to build their parts, this company needs to produce forecasts of how many parts they are going to sell over the next year. J&C uses a statistical engine to produce forecasts of how many parts they expect to sell over the next year for each individual part that they manufacture. This statistical engine uses historic data on the sales of the parts over the last year, runs multiple forecasting models, picks the forecasting model that fits best with that part’s historic data, and outputs a forecast based on that model. J&C runs the statistical engine once per month in order to update the historic data with the most recent sales. Unfortunately, J&C’s statistical engine is liable to have huge swings in the number of parts forecasted from month to month. 

One researcher wants to investigate how large the swings are on an individual part basis. He also wants to investigate whether changing between the forecasting model used for each part affects the magnitude of the swing in the number of that part forecasted.
